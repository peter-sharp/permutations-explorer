# Permutations explorer
Flask app that finds all permutations of a given word

## quickstart

 1. ```sh
    pyenv exec pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
 2. ```sh
    pyenv exec python main.py
    ```

## tests
```sh
pyenv exec python string_permutations_test.py
```

## why
Practising multi-processing in Python by using processes to keep app responsive while finding permutations. Learned a lot about inter-process communication and process cleanup (still not perfect).
